# Data Structure Projects Repository

Welcome to the Data Structure Projects Repository for the Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class!

## Overview

This repository serves as a collection of all the projects completed throughout the OOP and Data Structures C++ course, focusing on various data structure implementations and applications. From AVL trees to stacks and queues, each project demonstrates a fundamental understanding of different data structures commonly used in software development.

## Contents

- **AVL Tree Implementation**
  - Description: Implementation of an AVL tree data structure for efficient searching and retrieval of data.
  - Implementation: Self-balancing tree structure ensuring logarithmic time complexity for operations.

- **Binary Tree Implementation**
  - Description: Implementation of a binary tree data structure for organizing data hierarchically.
  - Implementation: Recursive structure supporting efficient traversal and searching.

- **Classes and Object-Oriented Programming**
  - Description: Projects showcasing the use of classes and OOP principles in various contexts.
  - Implementation: Object-oriented design for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

- **Heap Implementation**
  - Description: Implementation of a heap data structure for efficient priority queue operations.
  - Implementation: Binary heap structure supporting insertion, deletion, and heap operations.

- **Stack and Queue Implementations**
  - Description: Implementations of stack and queue data structures for managing data in a FIFO or LIFO manner.
  - Implementation: Array-based and linked list-based implementations for different use cases.

- **Various Types of Linked Lists**
  - Description: Implementations of different types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
  - Implementation: Versatile linked list structures for various data organization needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, navigate to the specific project folder you're interested in. Inside each project folder, you'll find the following structure:

- **includes:** Contains header (.h) and source (.cpp) files constructing the data structures or classes.
- **tests:** Contains unit tests for the implemented data structures. Feel free to run either basic_test or testB

Explore the implementations, experiment with the data structures, and learn about their applications in software development.
